        An abundance of grandeur; a mountain of opulence; an attendance of the holy of the holiest. While divine architects and lords prepped the venue, guests from the fourteen worlds committed their presence. A marriage that is larger than life.
        This was how Lord Venkateshwara’s divine union with Goddess Padmavathi happened centuries ago. It is said that this celestial wedding is like nothing humankind has ever seen. Be a part of this auspicious event virtually.
